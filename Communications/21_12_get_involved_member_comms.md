# The "Get Involved" Email Blast

This is an email put together for all .NET Foundation members to raise awareness of how they can help out in shaping the .NET Foundation, and hopefully encourage "passive" members to become more active within the .NET Foundation.

- To: All Members (Mailing List)
- Subject: Help build your .NET Foundation

---

In the .NET Foundation, people are key to our success. We are passionate about empowering projects, communities, and individuals to thrive and evangelise within the .NET ecosystem; but this only starts with members who are keen to do so.

You're here because you're passionate about .NET, and have made substantial contributions to surrounding projects and communities. The .NET Foundation is here to help you take that passion further, and shape the .NET community as a whole to make it better for everyone. So whether you maintain a .NET project, or have contributed to one; whether you write code, manage a community, or just about anything else; we're glad you're here and want to build the .NET Foundation and the .NET community you all want to see.

The best way to get started? Get involved in one of the .NET Foundation committees!

One of the benefits of being a .NET Foundation member is being able to partake and directly help with the many committees that drive the .NET Foundation and help further its particular goals. Anyone can join a committee and help out, and you can be a member of as many committees as you'd like. This is your .NET Foundation, and we'd love your help to build it!

Below is a summary of the various committees within the .NET Foundation. If there's anything you're particularly passionate about, get involved and let them know!
